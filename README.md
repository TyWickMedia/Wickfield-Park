## Stack

One static page — `index.html` with inline CSS and a few lines of vanilla JS. No build step, no
dependencies, no third-party requests except the Google Maps embed. Preview it by opening the file,
or:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000    # then visit http://localhost:8000
```

The header and footer logos are inlined directly in `index.html` (so they pick up the webfont).
If you change the logo, update those two inline `<svg>` blocks as well as the files above.

## The day you open: flip one switch

The site currently runs in pre-opening mode. One flag at the bottom of `index.html` controls it:

```js
const FIREFLY = {
  bookingUrl: "https://app.fireflyreservations.com/reserve/property/WickfieldPark",
  bookingOpen: false,   // ← flip to true the day reservations open
  embed: false
};
```

**`bookingOpen: false`** (now) — the top bar and hero say "Opening soon", every call-to-action reads
"Ask About Dates" and scrolls to the contact form, and the reservations section invites people to
send their dates.

**`bookingOpen: true`** — the same page says "Now taking reservations", every call-to-action changes
its wording ("Check Availability", "Book Your Site") and points at Firefly in a new tab, and the
reservations section switches to the reserve card. Nothing else needs editing.

The wording for both states lives in the HTML: `data-open-text` on the two "opening soon" phrases,
and `data-open-label` / `data-open-href` on each button. To reword a button for the open state, edit
its `data-open-label`.

`embed` only matters once `bookingOpen` is true. `false` opens Firefly in a new tab (the safe
default). `true` loads their calendar in an iframe on the page — check it on the live site first,
because many booking engines send `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and would leave a blank box. If Firefly
gives you a `<script>` widget snippet instead of a URL, paste it inside `#firefly-frame`.

## Still to do before launch

Search the file for `TODO`.

- [ ] **Test the contact form** — it posts to Formspree form `xppzrglw`. Formspree needs you to
      confirm the first submission from a new form, so send yourself a test message once the site is
      on a real domain. With the park pre-opening, every call-to-action leads here.
- [ ] **Drive times** — the location section lists ~10 min to campus / stadium / downtown. Verify.
- [ ] **Check-in / check-out times** and any park rules to publish.
- [ ] **Photos** — the site is deliberately photo-free for now (drawn horizons and icons instead).
      When photos exist, the natural slots are the hero background, the illustrated panel in
      "Built for big rigs", and a new gallery section.
- [ ] **Site specs** — exact length/width, surface, and whether water & sewer are at every site.
      The page currently claims electric and WiFi only.
- [ ] **Opening date** — the page says "Opening soon" with no date. Add one when you have it, and
      flip `bookingOpen` when reservations open.

## Hosting
